Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    an inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up whatever width is necessary 
    whereas a block element always starts on a new line and takes up or stretches the entire length of 
    the space it is occupying from left to right

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    an absolutely positioned element is fixed to a specific position ie: top - bottom - right - left

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    use an inline element and assign a width or margin property style within css

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block elements <div> <h1-h6> <p> - inline elements <span> <a> inline-block elements <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    box model has multiple parts (content, padding, border & margin) and basically defines the size of the box and all parts must be
    considered when determing the placement of content within a box - width+padding+border=actual width of element and 
    height+padding+border=actual height of element / can use box-sizing property to adjust these values to make content 
    appear in different locations within a box
